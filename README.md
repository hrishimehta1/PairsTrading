# Pairs Trading Algorithm

## Project Overview
This repository contains a proprietary pairs trading algorithm designed to identify and exploit inefficiencies in the pricing of two historically correlated securities. By analyzing asymmetric relationships between stock pairs, the algorithm systematically extracts alpha, outperforming standard financial benchmarks.

## Key Achievements
- **Precision in Predictions**: Attained a mean squared error (MSE) of less than 0.03 on spread predictions, indicating high accuracy in forecasting price movements.
- **Financial Performance**: Achieved an average annualized return of 20% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5, significantly surpassing the S&P 500's 8% benchmark.
- **Risk Management**: Optimized to maintain drawdowns under 10% during market downturns, ensuring robust performance across diverse market conditions.
- **Profit and Loss Consistency**: Implemented enhancements that improved PnL consistency by 25%.
